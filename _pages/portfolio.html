<h2 style="color:#736AFF;">Northeastern Topology Seminar</h2>
<p>I’m co-organizing “Northeastern topology seminar” (“东北拓扑系列活动”) which meets on Tuesdays at 2 pm (unless informed otherwise). The seminar is held in hybrid mode. If you are interested in participarting the seminar or giving a talk, please shoot me an email. The ads of the past talks can be found on http://cos.neu.edu.cn/ (under the section “学术交流”).
The other co-organizers are: 陈亮 （东北师大），鄂强（大连海事），李风玲 （大连理工），钟立楠（延边大学）</p>

<p>Title: On H'-splittings of Seifert manifolds<br>
Abstract: In this talk, we introduce the H'-splittings for compact connected orientable 3-manifolds, and discuss some properties of H'-splittings of Seifert manifolds.</p>

<p>Title: Boundary of Groups<br>
Abstract: Gromov boundary provides a useful compactification for all infinite-diameter Gromov hyperbolic spaces. It consists of all geodesic rays starting at a given base-point and it is an essential tool in the study of the coarse geometry of hyperbolic groups. In this study we introduce a generalization of the Gromov boundary for all finitely generated groups. We construct the sublinearly Morse boundaries and show that it is a QI-invariant topological space and it is metrizable. We show the geometric genericity of points in this boundary using Patterson Sullivan measure on the visual boundary of CAT(0) spaces. Lastly we discuss the connection between the sublinearly Morse boundary and random walk on groups. As applications we answer open problems regarding QI-invariant models of random walk on CAT(0) groups and on mapping class groups.</p>

<p>Title: The earthquake metric<br>
Abstract: Earthquakes are natural generalisations of Fenchel-Nielsen twists deformations on Teichmüller space, and Thurston’s remarkable earthquake theorem asserts that any hyperbolic metric on a given closed surface can be deformed to any other by a unique (left) earthquake. This was famously employed by Kerckhoff in his proof of the Nielsen realisation problem, which quickly cemented their importance in Teichmüller theory. Geometrically speaking, however, (long) Earthquake paths are far from being “twist efficient” - indeed, Mirzakhani shows that earthquake flows on Teichmüller space are measure conjugate to the horocyclic flow. Motivated by wishing to understand how one might efficiently “earthquake” between hyperbolic structures, we initiate the first systematic study of the earthquake metric—a Finsler metric first introduced in Thurston’s “Minimal stretch maps between hyperbolic surfaces” preprint, and discover surprising connections to both the Thurston metric and the Weil-Petersson metric. This is work in collaboration with K. Ohshika, H. Pan and A. Papadopoulos.</p>

<p>Title: Augmentations and Exact Lagrangian surfaces<br>
Abstract: Exact Lagrangian surfaces are important objects in the derived Fukaya category. Augmentations are objects of the augmentation category, which is the contact analog of the Fukaya category. In this talk, we discuss various relations between augmentations and exact Lagrangian surfaces. In particular, we realize augmentations, which is an algebraic object, fully geometrically via exact Lagrangian surfaces.</p>

<p>Title: Finiteness properties of surface Thompson groups <br>
Abstract: I will start with an introduction to Thompson groups and their surface version. Then I will explain how one can determine their finiteness properties by calculating the connectivity of some special complexes. This is based on joint works with Javier Aramayona,  Julio Aroca,  Kai-Uwe  Bux, María Cumplido, Jonas Flechsig, Nansen Petrosyan and Rachal Skipper.</p>

<p>Title: Periodic directions on translation surfaces of genus 2<br>
Abstract: One generalization of flat structure on torus to oriented closed surface of genus greater than $1$ is called translation surface structure. When a surface is equipped with such a structure, we call it a translation surface. Given a translation surface $S$, like on a flat torus, there is a globally well-defined notion of direction on $S$, and geodesics on $S$ along a same direction are disjoint from each other, hence induces a flow on $S$. Such flows and their dynamical properties are important in the study of the symmetry group of $S$ which is called Veech group. In particular, when the flow on $S$ along one direction has only periodic regular orbits, we call this direction a periodic direction of $S$. In a joint-work with Anja Randecker, using the close relation between interval exchange transformations and flows on surfaces, we obtain a full classification of translation surfaces of genus $2$ with one singularity according to the size of their periodic directions sets. In this talk, I will first give some necessary background, then I will explain our result and give the rough idea of the proof.</p>

<p>Title: Virtual domination of 3-manifolds<br>
Abstract: In this talk, we survey known results on virtual domination of 3-manifolds, i.e. a 3-manifold has a finite cover that admits a non-zero degree to another 3-manifold. We have proved a sequence of results on this topic, in which the domains are closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, closed 3-manifold with positive simplicial volume, cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds, respectively. The good pants construction initiated by Kahn and Markovic is a crucial tool for all proofs of these results.</p>
