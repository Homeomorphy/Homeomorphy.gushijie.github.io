<h2 style="color:#736AFF;">Northeastern Topology Seminar</h2>
<p>I’m co-organizing “Northeastern topology seminar” (“东北拓扑系列活动”) which meets on Tuesdays at 2 pm (unless informed otherwise). The seminar is held in hybrid mode. If you are interested in participarting the seminar or giving a talk, please shoot me an email. The ads of the past talks can be found on http://cos.neu.edu.cn/ (under the section “学术交流”).
The other co-organizers are: 陈亮 （东北师大），鄂强（大连海事），李风玲 （大连理工），钟立楠（延边大学）</p>

<p><b>Zoom talk</b> May 16, 2023 9:00 am - 10:00 am</p>

<p>Title: Virtual domination of 3-manifolds<br>
Abstract: In this talk, we survey known results on virtual domination of 3-manifolds, i.e. a 3-manifold has a finite cover that admits a non-zero degree to another 3-manifold. We have proved a sequence of results on this topic, in which the domains are closed hyperbolic 3-manifold, closed 3-manifold with positive simplicial volume, cusped hyperbolic 3-manifolds, respectively. The good pants construction initiated by Kahn and Markovic is a crucial tool for all proofs of these results.</p>





<h2 style="color:#C0C0C0;">Workshop on Interactions of 3- & 4-dimensional Topology (past)</h2>
I co-organized with <a href="https://ymsc.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1032/2335.htm">Jianfeng Lin</a> and <a href="https://bicmr.pku.edu.cn/cn/content/lists/11_catid74_zc14.html">Yi Xie</a> an online workshop on Interactions of 3- & 4-dimensional Topology during March 10-12, 2023.
